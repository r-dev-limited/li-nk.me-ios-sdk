# ExampleApp (iOS)

- SwiftUI iOS app targeting iOS 14+
- Depends on the local Swift Package `LinkMeKit` via Swift Package Manager

Open `ExampleApp.xcodeproj` in Xcode 15+, build and run on a simulator.

The app imports `LinkMeKit` and listens to the link stream. On launch, it emits a fake payload to demonstrate that the dependency is wired correctly.
